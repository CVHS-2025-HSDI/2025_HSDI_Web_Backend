addCourse(29, 'AP Precalculus', 'AP Precalculus centers on functions modeling dynamic phenomena. This research-based exploration of functions is designed to better prepare students for college-level calculus and provide grounding for other mathematics and science courses. In this course, students study a broad spectrum of function types that are foundational for careers in mathematics, physics, biology, health science, social science, and data science. Furthermore, as AP Precalculus may be the last mathematics course of a student’s secondary education, the course is structured to provide a coherent capstone experience and is not exclusively focused on preparation for future courses. During this course, students acquire and apply mathematical tools in real-world modeling situations in preparation for using these tools in college-level calculus. Modeling, a central instructional theme for the course, helps students come to a deeper understanding of each function type. By examining scenarios, conditions, and data sets, as well as determining and validating an appropriate function model, students develop a greater comprehension of the nature and behavior of the function itself. The formal study of a function type through multiple representations (e.g., graphical, numerical, verbal, analytical), coupled with the application of the function type to a variety of contexts, provides students with a rich study of precalculus. Throughout this course, students develop and hone symbolic manipulation skills needed for future mathematics courses. They also solve equations and manipulate expressions for the many function types throughout the course. Students also learn that functions and their compositions, inverses, and transformations are understood through graphical, numerical, verbal, and analytical representations, which reveal different attributes of the functions and are useful for solving problems in mathematical and applied contexts. In turn, the skills learned in this course are widely applicable in a variety of future courses that involve quantitative reasoning. AP Precalculus fosters the development of a deep conceptual understanding of functions. Students learn that a function is a mathematical relation that maps a set of input values—the domain—to a set of output values—the range—such that each input value is uniquely mapped to an output value. At various points and over various intervals, a function takes on characteristics that can be classified with varying levels of precision and justification, depending on the function representation and available mathematical tools. Furthermore, a function can be classified as part of a function family based on the way in which values of different variables change simultaneously. Research indicates that deep understanding of functions and their graphs as embodying dynamic covariation of quantities best supports student preparation for calculus. With each function type, students develop and validate function models based on the characteristics of a bivariate data set, characteristics of covarying quantities and their relative rates of change, or a set of characteristics such as zeros, asymptotes, and extrema. These models are used to interpolate, extrapolate, and interpret information with varying degrees of accuracy for a given context or data set. Additionally, students also learn that every model is subject to assumptions and limitations related to the context. As a result of examining functions from many perspectives, students develop a conceptual understanding not only of specific function types but also of functions in general. This type of understanding helps students to engage with both familiar and novel contexts.', 5.0, 'Mathematics', ['math', 'mathematics', 'geometry', 'algebra'], '', [11, 12]);
addCourse(30, 'AP Calculus AB', 'AP Calculus AB and AP Calculus BC focus on students’ understanding of calculus concepts and provide experience with methods and applications. Through the use of big ideas of calculus (e.g., modeling change, approximation and limits, and analysis of functions), each course becomes a cohesive whole, rather than a collection of unrelated topics. Both courses require students to use definitions and theorems to build arguments and justify conclusions. The courses feature a multirepresentational approach to calculus, with concepts, results, and problems expressed graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally. Exploring connections among these representations builds understanding of how calculus applies limits to develop important ideas, definitions, formulas, and theorems. A sustained emphasis on clear communication of methods, reasoning, justifications, and conclusions is essential. Teachers and students should regularly use technology to reinforce relationships among functions, to confirm written work, to implement experimentation, and to assist in interpreting results.', 5.0, 'Mathematics', ['math', 'mathematics', 'geometry', 'algebra'], 'Before studying calculus, all students should complete the equivalent of four years of secondary mathematics designed for college-bound students: courses that should prepare them with a strong foundation in reasoning with algebraic symbols and working with algebraic structures. Prospective calculus students should take courses in which they study algebra, geometry, trigonometry, analytic geometry, and elementary functions. These functions include linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, and piecewise-defined functions. In particular, before studying calculus, students must be familiar with the properties of functions, the composition of functions, the algebra of functions, and the graphs of functions. Students must also understand the language of functions (domain and range, odd and even, periodic, symmetry, zeros, intercepts, and descriptors such as increasing and decreasing).
